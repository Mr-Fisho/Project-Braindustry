# Project-Braindustry
A remake for a very old mod credits to all the original quant team members who designed braindustry 
#How I got this idea
I got this idea because braindustry was a very good mod for its time and I highly appreciate the effor put into it.
It was all fun and games until all the sudden it got removed from the mod browser so I decided to remake it.
#How I started
I first started by drawing all the turrets on paper the every thing else then opened github and started work on projec braindustry
Many of the sprites are by Picaxe of Pixie so thank you if you are reading this
